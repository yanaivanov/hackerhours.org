description: I'm a web designer looking to learn front-end so that I can strengthen my credentials and transition into UX/UI Design field.
Since I am still very new to coding I am happy to contribute my design skills. I'm also pretty good at finding errors in code. I am familiar with html/css & some javascript so I can probably do some QA.
